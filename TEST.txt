GOOD:

BAD:
deep learning and big data - used to do more results towards deep learning but now includes big data
machine learning - used to run really slowly as there were a lot of machine learning datasets that were nearly the same, we increased performance by removing near duplicates
health informatics - used to give us bad results but now provides us with data about a robot used for individuals with disabilities as well as a student interning for health informatics
systems computing - used to give us bad results unrelated to systems, now we get results about networks and cyber security
professor in ics - used to give more results towards general professors but now towards ics
history of artificial intelligence - used to give information about ai, but now is more targetted towards history
how to find internships - used to be inaccurate, now finds intnerships
ai at uci - used to show general uci knowledge but now towards just ai at uci
important research papers on NLP - would show research papers on different topics now on NLP
research program - now provides us with many links on undergraduate research programs
